At HarrisPark Radiology, we are committed to leveraging cutting-edge technology to enhance diagnostic precision and improve patient outcomes. Among our most valuable tools for evaluating cardiovascular health is the Cardiac CT scan, a revolutionary imaging technique that provides detailed insights into the heart's anatomy, coronary circulation, and surrounding blood vessels.
A Cardiac CT scan is a non-invasive imaging procedure that uses X-rays to create high-resolution images of the heart and its associated structures. Physicians rely on this advanced diagnostic tool to detect various heart conditions, including coronary artery disease, blood clots, heart defects, tumors, and more.
Types of Cardiac CT Scans
Physicians may recommend one of two types of Cardiac CT scans, each serving distinct diagnostic purposes:
1. Calcium-Score Screening Heart Scan
This specialized test is designed to detect calcium deposits in the coronary arteries. These deposits, found in atherosclerotic plaque, are a critical indicator of early-stage coronary artery disease. By identifying coronary calcification, physicians can intervene before the condition progresses.
During the scan, a computer generates a calcium "score," which estimates the extent of arterial calcification. A negative scan indicates no detectable plaque, although it does not entirely rule out future cardiac risks.
This test is quick, painless, and does not require intravenous contrast dye. It is especially valuable for assessing the need for lifestyle changes to prevent heart disease.
2. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA)
Considered the "gold standard" for diagnosing coronary artery stenosis, Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) provides detailed, three-dimensional images of the heart and its vessels. This test is particularly useful for detecting blockages or narrowing in the arteries that can lead to serious health issues.
The procedure involves the use of an iodine-containing contrast dye to enhance imaging quality. In some cases, patients may receive medication to slow or stabilize their heart rate, ensuring optimal results.
CTA is a preferred diagnostic tool for individuals experiencing chest pain or those at high risk for coronary artery disease. With a scanning time of just 10 minutes, it offers a quick, non-invasive alternative to traditional catheter-based angiography.
The Future of Heart Disease Detection
The landscape of cardiovascular diagnostics is evolving rapidly, and the integration of innovative imaging technologies holds promise for more comprehensive heart disease detection. One such advancement is the combination of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with CTA scanning.
Preparing for Your Cardiac CT Scan
Proper preparation is essential to ensure the accuracy of your Cardiac CT scan. Follow these steps for a seamless experience:
•	Adhere to all pre-scan instructions: Your doctor may require you to complete blood work or other lab tests in advance.
•	Avoid caffeine: Refrain from consuming caffeine-containing food, drinks, or medications for at least 24 hours before the scan.
•	Stick to clear liquids: If recommended by your physician, drink only clear liquids after midnight before the test.
•	Inform your technologist: Notify the medical team if you are pregnant, undergoing radiation therapy, or have other specific medical concerns.
During and After the Scan
A Cardiac CT scan is straightforward and typically requires less than 30 minutes from start to finish. Here’s what to expect:
•	Preparation: You will change into a hospital gown, and your height, weight, and blood pressure may be recorded. An IV may be inserted if your scan requires contrast dye.
•	The scan: Lying on a motorized table, you’ll move through a doughnut-shaped scanner that synchronizes image capture with your heartbeat.
•	Image analysis: A radiologist and advanced software analyze the images, providing detailed insights into your heart health.
After the scan, you can resume your normal diet and activities immediately. Your results will be reviewed by a team of specialists, who will provide recommendations based on the findings. These may include lifestyle modifications, medication, or further diagnostic tests.
